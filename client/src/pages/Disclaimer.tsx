              <p>
                Trading in financial instruments involves high risks, including the risk of losing some, or all, of your investment amount. Before deciding to trade, you should carefully consider your investment objectives, level of experience, and risk appetite.
              </p>
              <p>
                The possibility exists that you could sustain a loss of some or all of your initial investment and therefore you should not invest money that you cannot afford to lose. You should be aware of all the risks associated with trading and seek advice from an independent financial advisor if you have any doubts.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-2xl mt-8">2. Not Financial Advice</h2>
